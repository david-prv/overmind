 * A source is part of an API, e.g. used by the third-party tools, which are in-built, but also
 * by the default integration procedure. These "sources" determine which online resources to use when
 * it comes to auto-pull requests. Such requests are required for example when automatically or manually
 * integrating tools to the framework for fetching latest information about the certain supply information
 * and details per engine.
