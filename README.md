A small framework to run open-source tools that inspect and scan any kind of webpages for vulnerabilities.  

**Disclaimer**: This tool is not intended to be used for any criminal act. It's used to find vulnerabilites on websites whose owners have given me express permission to do so! You are responsible for all your decisions.

## Roadmap
- FIX tool deletion issue in bundle.js ([issue #1](https://github.com/david-prv/scanner-bundle/issues/1))
- UPDATE `getArg()` method to be nullable
- UPDATE `Core.php` code (chunk code removal)
- ADD anti-virus scan for newly uploaded scanners
- ADD support for more native runners

## Requirements

 - Apache2
 - PHP (>= 8.2.0)
 - Python (>= 3.9.13)
 - Composer (>= 2.1.2)

## Firing Up & Getting Started

This application is only meant to be running locally. It's not supposed to be a public accessible application in the web. To run a local instance, you can either use `XAMPP` to run a local web-server, or just launch a PHP development server.
```bash
# in project's root folder...
php -S localhost:8080
```
Now open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The scanner-bundle framework should appear.
